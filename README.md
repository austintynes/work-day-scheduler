# work-day-scheduler

## Description

- What was your motivation?
- To build a work scheduling site that can take inputs for your daily tasks, block time frames and color coat them in relation to the times(past, present, future). Also to save the inputs in local storage and display them on the page upon reload.

- What problem does it solve?
  -Helping organize daily tasks with the user at work hour by hour from 9 AM to 5 PM.

- What did you learn?
  -I got much more comfortable with event listeners, and local storage and even the pesky flex boxes ive been struggling with.

## Credits

Tutor David Johnson via tutoring session on Calendly took my idea of using military time and really helped me iron out the logic for color scheming and the textareas based off comparing the current time to the textarea.
